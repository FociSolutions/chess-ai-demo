# UI/UX Improvements

## 🎯 Goal
Apply professional polish to turn a functional app into a delightful product.

## 🔑 Key Points
- **Visual Polish**: Added Lucide icons, a "Thinking" indicator, and a responsive grid layout.
- **Audio Feedback**: Implemented a `useSound` hook for immersive move and capture effects.
- **Feature Depth**: Added a "Captured Pieces" tracker with material score and a structured move history table.
- **Accessibility**: Fixed dark mode contrast issues to ensure usability in all environments.

## 📺 Demo Flow
1. **Play a Game**: Let the user hear the sounds and see the thinking indicator.
2. **Capture a Piece**: Point out the score update in the sidebar.
3. **Toggle Dark Mode**: Show how the UI adapts seamlessly.

## 💡 Takeaway
> "Polish is where good becomes great. AI agents can deliver production-quality work, not just functional prototypes."
