# Refine Board Interactions

## 🎯 Goal
Optimize performance and remove unnecessary complexity to improve the user experience.

## 🔑 Key Points
- **Simplification**: Removed unused keyboard navigation to focus on the core drag-and-drop experience.
- **Visual Fixes**: Corrected board highlighting logic so users clearly see legal moves and the last move made.
- **Engine Tuning**: Fixed a bug where difficulty settings were ignored, ensuring "Easy" is actually easy (and fast).

## 📺 Demo Flow
1. **Play on Easy**: Show the immediate AI response (Depth 5).
2. **Highlighting**: Click a piece to demonstrate the fixed legal move indicators.
3. **Explain**: We pruned features to focus on quality over quantity.

## 💡 Takeaway
> "Refinement isn't just about adding—it's about pruning. This phase shows AI agents can both build and optimize."
