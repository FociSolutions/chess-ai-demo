# Starting State: BRD & PRD

## 🎯 Goal
Establish a solid business and technical foundation before writing a single line of code.

## 🔑 Key Points
- **Business Requirements (BRD)**: Defines the "Why" and "Who". Prevents scope creep by locking down user stories early.
- **Product Requirements (PRD)**: Defines the "How". Specifies the tech stack (React, Vite, TS) and constraints so the AI doesn't guess.

## 📺 Demo Flow
1. **Open `docs/BRD.md`**: Highlight the Problem Statement and User Stories.
2. **Open `docs/PRD.md`**: Show the Tech Stack decisions.
3. **Explain**: These docs serve as the "North Star" for the AI agent.

## 💡 Takeaway
> "In Spec-Driven Development, we invest time upfront in requirements so AI agents can execute with precision and purpose."
