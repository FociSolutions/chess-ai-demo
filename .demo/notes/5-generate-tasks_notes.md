# Generate Tasks

## 🎯 Goal
Break down the plan into a concrete, executable task list for the AI agents.

## 🔑 Key Points
- **Granular Breakdown**: Generated 58 atomic tasks, ensuring each step is small, testable, and manageable.
- **Phased Execution**: Organized work into 6 phases (Setup → Foundational → MVP → Polish) to manage complexity.
- **MVP Definition**: Clearly defined User Story 1 as the "MVP boundary" to prioritize shipping value early.

## 📺 Demo Flow
1. **Open `tasks.md`**: Scroll through the phase structure.
2. **Highlight MVP Scope**: Show how tasks are prioritized.
3. **Explain Dependencies**: Point out how tasks are ordered.

## 💡 Takeaway
> "tasks.md is the AI agent's work order—every task is atomic, ordered, and traceable."
