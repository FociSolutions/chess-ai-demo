# Installed Spec Kit

## 🎯 Goal
Install the tooling that brings structure to spec-driven development.

## 🔑 Key Points
- **Initialization**: Ran `specify init` to set up the project's specification framework.
- **Structure**: Created the `.specify/` directory and standard templates for consistency, and created agent specifc files such as GitHub Copilot agents and prompts
- **Value**: Provides a predictable file structure that AI agents can easily navigate and understand.

## 📺 Demo Flow
1. **Show the command**: Point out `specify init` in the terminal history.
2. **Explore `.specify/`**: Briefly show the folder structure created.
3. **Explain**: This structure provides tools, templates, and workflow to create directions from specifications.

## 💡 Takeaway
> "Spec Kit transforms ad-hoc documentation into a structured system that both humans and AI agents can navigate efficiently."
