# MVP Chess Game

## 🎯 Goal
Execute the first 3 phases of the task list to deliver a fully functional, testable MVP.

## 🔑 Key Points
- **Rapid Implementation**: Built the entire stack (Vite/React/TS), game logic (chess.js), and UI (react-chessboard) in one go.
- **Problem Solving**: AI autonomously identified and fixed a critical API mismatch in `react-chessboard` v5.
- **Quality Assurance**: Delivered 35 passing tests covering both unit logic and integration flows.

## 📺 Demo Flow
1. **Play a Move**: Drag and drop a piece to show the UI works.
2. **Change Difficulty**: Show the settings working.
3. **Run Tests**: Execute `npm test` to prove the code is robust, not just a prototype.

## 💡 Takeaway
> "In a single phase, the AI agent went from a task list to a fully functional, tested application."
