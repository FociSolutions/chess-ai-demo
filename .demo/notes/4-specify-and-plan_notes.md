# Specify & Plan

## 🎯 Goal
Translate high-level requirements into a precise technical specification and implementation plan.

## 🔑 Key Points
- **Specification (`spec.md`)**: AI generated detailed User Stories and Functional Requirements directly from the BRD.
- **Implementation Plan (`plan.md`)**: AI mapped the PRD's technical constraints (React, Stockfish) into a concrete architecture.
- **Critical Clarification**: Explicitly defined that "AI time budget overruns are defects," setting a hard quality bar.

## 📺 Demo Flow
1. **Chat using the `specify agent`**: specify the desire for a single player chess experiance using the BRD as context.
2. **Open `specs/001-single-player-chess/spec.md`**: Show how User Stories map to requirements.
3. **Chat using the `plan agent`**: generate a technical plan using hte PRD as context.
4. **Open `plan.md`**: Highlight the architecture section.
5. **Show Checklist**: Demonstrate how we ensure no requirement is lost in translation.

## 💡 Takeaway
> "The spec and plan are the contract between business needs and technical execution. AI agents can be used to implement this plan."
