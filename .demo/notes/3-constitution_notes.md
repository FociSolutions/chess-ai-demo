# Constitution v1.1.0

## 🎯 Goal
Establish the core principles and guardrails that guide every AI decision.

## 🔑 Key Points
- **New Principles (VII-XII)**: Added critical rules for Error Handling, Immutability, Performance, and API Stability.
- **Project DNA**: The constitution acts as a "value system" that agents inherit, ensuring consistent quality.
- **Autonomous Guidance**: When the AI faces a choice, it checks the constitution first.

## 📺 Demo Flow
1. **Open `constitution.md`**: Scroll to the new sections (VII-XII).
2. **Highlight "Error Handling"**: Show how it mandates graceful degradation.
3. **Explain**: This ensures that even different AI agents produce code that feels like it came from one cohesive team.

## 💡 Takeaway
> "A constitution doesn't just describe how to code—it teaches AI agents *why* we code certain ways."
