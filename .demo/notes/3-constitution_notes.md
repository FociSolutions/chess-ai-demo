# Constitution

## 🎯 Goal
Establish the core principles and guardrails that guide every AI decision.

## 🔑 Key Points
- **New Principles**: Added rules for common programming challenges such as Error Handling, Immutability, Performance, and API Stability.
- **Project DNA**: The constitution acts as a "value system" that agents inherit, ensuring consistent quality.
- **Autonomous Guidance**: When the AI faces a choice, it checks the constitution first.

## 📺 Demo Flow
1. **Chat using the `constitution agent`**: To set rules for the development
2. **Open `constitution.md`**: Explore and explain the file.
3. **Highlight "Error Handling"**: Show how it mandates graceful degradation.
4. **Explain**: This ensures that even different AI agents produce code that feels like it came from one cohesive team.

## 💡 Takeaway
> "A constitution provides the guardrails to the AI Agent to direct a specifc sytle of code."
